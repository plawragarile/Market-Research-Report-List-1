<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Viscometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotational Viscometer</li><li>Capillary Viscometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The blood viscometer market is primarily divided into two types: rotational viscometers and capillary viscometers. Rotational viscometers measure the viscosity of blood by applying a rotational force, allowing for real-time monitoring of fluid behavior under varying shear rates. Capillary viscometers, on the other hand, determine viscosity by observing the time it takes for blood to flow through a narrow capillary tube under gravity. Both types are essential for assessing blood flow properties, crucial for diagnostics and clinical research.</p></p>
