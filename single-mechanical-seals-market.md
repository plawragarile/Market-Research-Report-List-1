<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pusher Type Seal</li><li>Non-pusher Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The single mechanical seals market can be segmented into two main types: pusher seals and non-pusher seals. Pusher type seals feature a movable part that maintains contact with the rotating shaft, allowing for compensation of wear and ensuring a tighter seal over time. In contrast, non-pusher seals have a fixed design that does not adjust to wear, leading to a potentially shorter lifespan. Both types are essential for various industrial applications, ensuring effective sealing in rotating equipment and reducing leakage.</p></p>
