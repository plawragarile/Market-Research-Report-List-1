<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Car Engine Camshafts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flat-tappet Cams (Bottom)</li><li>Roller Cams (Top)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The car engine camshaft market is primarily divided into two types: flat-tappet cams and roller cams. Flat-tappet cams feature a simple design with a flat profile, commonly used in older engines due to their cost-effectiveness, but they experience more wear. Roller cams, on the other hand, utilize roller followers that reduce friction and enhance performance, making them popular in high-performance and modern engines. Both types serve distinct applications, offering varying benefits in terms of longevity and efficiency.</p></p>
